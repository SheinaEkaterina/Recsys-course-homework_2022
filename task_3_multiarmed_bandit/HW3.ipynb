Для TS я изменил simulation и в случае победы добавлял 1 к alpha, а в случае поражения ts_reward к beta баннера. Наиболее оптимальные ts_reward 2 и 4, они достаточно схожи. Итоговый наилучший regret получился похожим у UCB и TS и равен примерно 1050-1080, и это лучше бейзлайна, регрет которго 1540."
